      "of it. On the table, a lighted lamp, with a lampshade. At the back of\n",
      "the room, an open door leads to the dining-room. BILLING is seen\n",
      "sitting at the dining table, on which a lamp is burning. He has a\n",
      "napkin tucked under his chin, and MRS. STOCKMANN is standing by the\n",
      "table handing him a large plate-full of roast beef. The other places at\n",
      "the table are empty, and the table somewhat in disorder, evidently a\n",
      "meal having recently been finished.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. You see, if you come an hour late, Mr. Billing, you\n",
      "have to put up with cold meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing (as he eats). It is uncommonly good, thank you—remarkably good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. My husband makes such a point of having his meals\n",
      "punctually, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. That doesn't affect me a bit. Indeed, I almost think I enjoy a\n",
      "meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself, and\n",
      "undisturbed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Oh well, as long as you are enjoying it—. (Turns to\n",
      "the hall door, listening.) I expect that is Mr. Hovstad coming too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Very likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "(PETER STOCKMANN comes in. He wears an overcoat and his official hat,\n",
      "and carries a stick.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Good evening, Katherine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). Ah, good\n",
      "evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I happened to be passing, and so—(looks into the\n",
      "dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann (a little embarrassed). Oh, no—it was quite by chance\n",
      "he came in. (Hurriedly.) Won't you come in and have something, too?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night!\n",
      "Not with my digestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, but just once in a way—\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and\n",
      "butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more\n",
      "economical, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann (smiling). Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are\n",
      "spendthrifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.\n",
      "(Points to the Doctor's study.) Is he not at home?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. No, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and\n",
      "the boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (Listens.) I\n",
      "fancy I hear him coming now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. No, I don't think it is he. (A knock is heard at the\n",
      "door.) Come in! (HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.) Oh, it is you, Mr.\n",
      "Hovstad!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the\n",
      "printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann (bowing a little distantly). Good evening. You have\n",
      "come on business, no doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Partly. It's about an article for the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. So I imagined. I hear my brother has become a prolific\n",
      "contributor to the \"People's Messenger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes, he is good enough to write in the \"People's Messenger\"\n",
      "when he has any home truths to tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann (to HOVSTAD). But won't you—? (Points to the\n",
      "dining-room.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Quite so, quite so. I don't blame him in the least, as\n",
      "a writer, for addressing himself to the quarters where he will find the\n",
      "readiest sympathy. And, besides that, I personally have no reason to\n",
      "bear any ill will to your paper, Mr. Hovstad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. I quite agree with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Taking one thing with another, there is an excellent\n",
      "spirit of toleration in the town—an admirable municipal spirit. And it\n",
      "all springs from the fact of our having a great common interest to\n",
      "unite us—an interest that is in an equally high degree the concern of\n",
      "every right-minded citizen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. The Baths, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Exactly—-our fine, new, handsome Baths. Mark my\n",
      "words, Mr. Hovstad—the Baths will become the focus of our municipal\n",
      "life! Not a doubt of it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. That is just what Thomas says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Think how extraordinarily the place has developed\n",
      "within the last year or two! Money has been flowing in, and there is\n",
      "some life and some business doing in the town. Houses and landed\n",
      "property are rising in value every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. And unemployment is diminishing,\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, that is another thing. The burden on the poor\n",
      "rates has been lightened, to the great relief of the propertied\n",
      "classes; and that relief will be even greater if only we get a really\n",
      "good summer this year, and lots of visitors—plenty of invalids, who\n",
      "will make the Baths talked about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. And there is a good prospect of that, I hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. It looks very promising. Inquiries about apartments\n",
      "and that sort of thing are reaching us, every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Well, the doctor's article will come in very suitably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Has he been writing something just lately?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. This is something he wrote in the winter; a recommendation of\n",
      "the Baths—an account of the excellent sanitary conditions here. But I\n",
      "held the article over, temporarily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Ah,—some little difficulty about it, I suppose?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. No, not at all; I thought it would be better to wait until the\n",
      "spring, because it is just at this time that people begin to think\n",
      "seriously about their summer quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Quite right; you were perfectly right, Mr. Hovstad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes, Thomas is really indefatigable when it is a question of\n",
      "the Baths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Well remember, he is the Medical Officer to the Baths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes, and what is more, they owe their existence to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. To him? Indeed! It is true I have heard from time to\n",
      "time that some people are of that opinion. At the same time I must say\n",
      "I imagined that I took a modest part in the enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, that is what Thomas is always saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. But who denies it, Mr. Stockmann? You set the thing going and\n",
      "made a practical concern of it; we all know that. I only meant that the\n",
      "idea of it came first from the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Oh, ideas yes! My brother has had plenty of them in\n",
      "his time—unfortunately. But when it is a question of putting an idea\n",
      "into practical shape, you have to apply to a man of different mettle,\n",
      "Mr. Hovstad. And I certainly should have thought that in this house at\n",
      "least...\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. My dear Peter—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. How can you think that—?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Won't you go in and have something, Mr. Hovstad? My\n",
      "husband is sure to be back directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Thank you, perhaps just a morsel. (Goes into the dining-room.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann (lowering his voice a little). It is a curious thing\n",
      "that these farmers' sons never seem to lose their want of tact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Surely it is not worth bothering about! Cannot you and\n",
      "Thomas share the credit as brothers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I should have thought so; but apparently some people\n",
      "are not satisfied with a share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. What nonsense! You and Thomas get on so capitally\n",
      "together. (Listens.) There he is at last, I think. (Goes out and opens\n",
      "the door leading to the hall.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (laughing and talking outside). Look here—here is\n",
      "another guest for you, Katherine. Isn't that jolly! Come in, Captain\n",
      "Horster; hang your coat up on this peg. Ah, you don't wear an overcoat.\n",
      "Just think, Katherine; I met him in the street and could hardly\n",
      "persuade him to come up! (CAPTAIN HORSTER comes into the room and\n",
      "greets MRS. STOCKMANN. He is followed by DR. STOCKMANN.) Come along in,\n",
      "boys. They are ravenously hungry again, you know. Come along, Captain\n",
      "Horster; you must have a slice of beef. (Pushes HORSTER into the\n",
      "dining-room. EJLIF and MORTEN go in after them.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas, don't you see—?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (turning in the doorway). Oh, is it you, Peter? (Shakes\n",
      "hands with him.) Now that is very delightful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Unfortunately I must go in a moment—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Rubbish! There is some toddy just coming in. You haven't\n",
      "forgotten the toddy, Katherine?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Of course not; the water is boiling now. (Goes into the\n",
      "dining-room.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Toddy too!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, sit down and we will have it comfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Thanks, I never care about an evening's drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But this isn't an evening's drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. It seems to me—. (Looks towards the dining-room.) It\n",
      "is extraordinary how they can put away all that food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (rubbing his hands). Yes, isn't it splendid to see young\n",
      "people eat? They have always got an appetite, you know! That's as it\n",
      "should be. Lots of food—to build up their strength! They are the\n",
      "people who are going to stir up the fermenting forces of the future,\n",
      "Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. May I ask what they will find here to \"stir up,\" as\n",
      "you put it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Ah, you must ask the young people that—when the times\n",
      "comes. We shan't be able to see it, of course. That stands to\n",
      "reason—two old fogies, like us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Really, really! I must say that is an extremely odd\n",
      "expression to—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Oh, you mustn't take me too literally, Peter. I am so\n",
      "heartily happy and contented, you know. I think it is such an\n",
      "extraordinary piece of good fortune to be in the middle of all this\n",
      "growing, germinating life. It is a splendid time to live in! It is as\n",
      "if a whole new world were being created around one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Do you really think so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Ah, naturally you can't appreciate it as keenly as I.\n",
      "You have lived all your life in these surroundings, and your\n",
      "impressions have been blunted. But I, who have been buried all these\n",
      "years in my little corner up north, almost without ever seeing a\n",
      "stranger who might bring new ideas with him—well, in my case it has\n",
      "just the same effect as if I had been transported into the middle of a\n",
      "crowded city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Oh, a city—!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I know, I know; it is all cramped enough here, compared\n",
      "with many other places. But there is life here—there is promise—there\n",
      "are innumerable things to work for and fight for; and that is the main\n",
      "thing. (Calls.) Katherine, hasn't the postman been here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann (from the dining-room). No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And then to be comfortably off, Peter! That is something\n",
      "one learns to value, when one has been on the brink of starvation, as\n",
      "we have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Oh, surely—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Indeed I can assure you we have often been very hard put\n",
      "to it, up there. And now to be able to live like a lord! Today, for\n",
      "instance, we had roast beef for dinner—and, what is more, for supper\n",
      "too. Won't you come and have a little bit? Or let me show it you, at\n",
      "any rate? Come here—\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. No, no—not for worlds!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well, but just come here then. Do you see, we have got a\n",
      "table-cover?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, I noticed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And we have got a lamp-shade too. Do you see? All out of\n",
      "Katherine's savings! It makes the room so cosy. Don't you think so?\n",
      "Just stand here for a moment—no, no, not there—just here, that's it!\n",
      "Look now, when you get the light on it altogether. I really think it\n",
      "looks very nice, doesn't it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Oh, if you can afford luxuries of this kind—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, I can afford it now. Katherine tells me I earn\n",
      "almost as much as we spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Almost—yes!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But a scientific man must live in a little bit of style.\n",
      "I am quite sure an ordinary civil servant spends more in a year than I\n",
      "do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I daresay. A civil servant—a man in a well-paid\n",
      "position...\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well, any ordinary merchant, then! A man in that\n",
      "position spends two or three times as much as—\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. It just depends on circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. At all events I assure you I don't waste money\n",
      "unprofitably. But I can't find it in my heart to deny myself the\n",
      "pleasure of entertaining my friends. I need that sort of thing, you\n",
      "know. I have lived for so long shut out of it all, that it is a\n",
      "necessity of life to me to mix with young, eager, ambitious men, men of\n",
      "liberal and active minds; and that describes every one of those fellows\n",
      "who are enjoying their supper in there. I wish you knew more of Hovstad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. By the way, Hovstad was telling me he was going to\n",
      "print another article of yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. An article of mine?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, about the Baths. An article you wrote in the\n",
      "winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Oh, that one! No, I don't intend that to appear just for\n",
      "the present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Why not? It seems to me that this would be the most\n",
      "opportune moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, very likely—under normal conditions. (Crosses the\n",
      "room.)\n",
      "\n",

      "abnormal about the present conditions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (standing still). To tell you the truth, Peter, I can't\n",
      "say just at this moment—at all events not tonight. There may be much\n",
      "that is very abnormal about the present conditions—and it is possible\n",
      "there may be nothing abnormal about them at all. It is quite possible\n",
      "it may be merely my imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I must say it all sounds most mysterious. Is there\n",
      "something going on that I am to be kept in ignorance of? I should have\n",
      "imagined that I, as Chairman of the governing body of the Baths—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And I should have imagined that I—. Oh, come, don't let\n",
      "us fly out at one another, Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Heaven forbid! I am not in the habit of flying out at\n",
      "people, as you call it. But I am entitled to request most emphatically\n",
      "that all arrangements shall be made in a businesslike manner, through\n",
      "the proper channels, and shall be dealt with by the legally constituted\n",
      "authorities. I can allow no going behind our backs by any roundabout\n",
      "means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Have I ever at any time tried to go behind your backs?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. You have an ingrained tendency to take your own way,\n",
      "at all events; and, that is almost equally inadmissible in a well\n",
      "ordered community. The individual ought undoubtedly to acquiesce in\n",
      "subordinating himself to the community—or, to speak more accurately,\n",
      "to the authorities who have the care of the community's welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Very likely. But what the deuce has all this got to do\n",
      "with me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. That is exactly what you never appear to be willing to\n",
      "learn, my dear Thomas. But, mark my words, some day you will have to\n",
      "suffer for it—sooner or later. Now I have told you. Good-bye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Have you taken leave of your senses? You are on the\n",
      "wrong scent altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I am not usually that. You must excuse me now if I—\n",
      "(calls into the dining-room). Good night, Katherine. Good night,\n",

      "Mrs. Stockmann. But, dear Thomas, what have you been doing to him again?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Nothing at all. And, anyhow, he can't oblige me to make\n",
      "my report before the proper time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. What have you got to make a report to him about?\n",
      "\n",

      "that toddy, Katherine?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann (going into the dining-room). I am just getting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Sit down here on the couch beside me, Captain Horster.\n",
      "We so seldom see you. Please sit down, my friends. (They sit down at\n",
      "the table. MRS. STOCKMANN brings a tray, with a spirit-lamp, glasses,\n",
      "bottles, etc., upon it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. There you are! This is arrack, and this is rum, and\n",
      "this one is the brandy. Now every one must help themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (taking a glass). We will. (They all mix themselves some\n",
      "toddy.) And let us have the cigars. Ejlif, you know where the box is.\n",
      "And you, Morten, can fetch my pipe. (The two boys go into the room on\n",
      "the right.) I have a suspicion that Ejlif pockets a cigar now and\n",
      "then!—but I take no notice of it. (Calls out.) And my smoking-cap too,\n",
      "Morten. Katherine, you can tell him where I left it. Ah, he has got it.\n",
      "(The boys bring the various things.) Now, my friends. I stick to my\n",
      "pipe, you know. This one has seen plenty of bad weather with me up\n",
      "north. (Touches glasses with them.) Your good health! Ah, it is good to\n",
      "be sitting snug and warm here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann (who sits knitting). Do you sail soon, Captain Horster?\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. I expect to be ready to sail next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. I suppose you are going to America?\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Yes, that is the plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Then you won't be able to take part in the coming\n",
      "election?\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Is there going to be an election?\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Didn't you know?\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. No, I don't mix myself up with those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. But do you not take an interest in public affairs?\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. No, I don't know anything about politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. All the same, one ought to vote, at any rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Even if one doesn't know anything about what is going on?\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Doesn't know! What do you mean by that? A community is like a\n",
      "ship; everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Maybe that is all very well on shore; but on board ship it\n",
      "wouldn't work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. It is astonishing how little most sailors care about what goes\n",
      "on on shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Very extraordinary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Sailors are like birds of passage; they feel equally at\n",
      "home in any latitude. And that is only an additional reason for our\n",

      "interest in tomorrow's \"Messenger\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Nothing about municipal affairs. But the day after tomorrow I\n",

      "a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Really? We had just got convenient space for it, and I thought\n",
      "it was just the opportune moment—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes, very likely you are right; but it must wait\n",
      "all the same. I will explain to you later. (PETRA comes in from the\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Petra (coming to the table). Thanks, I would rather do it; you always\n",
      "mix it too strong. But I forgot, father—I have a letter for you. (Goes\n",
      "to the chair where she has laid her things.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. A letter? From whom?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra (looking in her coat pocket). The postman gave it to me just as I\n",
      "was going out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (getting up and going to her). And you only give to me\n",
      "now!\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (seizing the letter). Let's see, let's see, child! (Looks\n",
      "at the address.) Yes, that's all right!\n",

      "Thomas?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, your lamp is already lit on your desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Good, good. Excuse me for a moment—, (Goes into his\n",

      "\n",
      "Petra. What do you suppose it is, mother?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. I don't know; for the last day or two he has always\n",
      "been asking if the postman has not been.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Probably some country patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Poor old dad!—he will overwork himself soon. (Mixes a glass for\n",
      "herself.) There, that will taste good!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Have you been teaching in the evening school again today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra (sipping from her glass). Two hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. And four hours of school in the morning?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Five hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. And you have still got exercises to correct, I see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. A whole heap, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. You are pretty full up with work too, it seems to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Yes—but that is good. One is so delightfully tired after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Do you like that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Yes, because one sleeps so well then.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Petra. Wicked?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten. Yes, because you work so much. Mr. Rorlund says work is a\n",
      "punishment for our sins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ejlif. Pooh, what a duffer, you are, to believe a thing like that!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Come, come, Ejlif!\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing (laughing). That's capital!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Don't you want to work as hard as that, Morten?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten. No, indeed I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. What do you want to be, then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten. I should like best to be a Viking,\n",
      "\n",
      "Ejlif. You would have to be a pagan then.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten. Well, I could become a pagan, couldn't I?\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. I agree with you, Morten! My sentiments, exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann (signalling to him). I am sure that is not true, Mr.\n",
      "Billing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Yes, I swear it is! I am a pagan, and I am proud of it.\n",
      "Believe me, before long we shall all be pagans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten. And then shall be allowed to do anything we like?\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Well, you'll see, Morten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. You must go to your room now, boys; I am sure you have\n",
      "some lessons to learn for tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ejlif. I should like so much to stay a little longer—\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. No, no; away you go, both of you, (The boys say good\n",
      "night and go into the room on the left.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Do you really think it can do the boys any harm to hear such\n",
      "things?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. I don't know; but I don't like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. But you know, mother, I think you really are wrong about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Maybe, but I don't like it—not in our own home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. There is so much falsehood both at home and at school. At home\n",
      "one must not speak, and at school we have to stand and tell lies to the\n",
      "children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Tell lies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Yes, don't you suppose we have to teach them all sorts of things\n",
      "that we don't believe?\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. That is perfectly true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. If only I had the means, I would start a school of my own; and\n",
      "it would be conducted on very different lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Oh, bother the means—!\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Well if you are thinking of that, Miss Stockmann, I shall be\n",
      "delighted to provide you with a schoolroom. The great big old house my\n",
      "father left me is standing almost empty; there is an immense\n",
      "dining-room downstairs—\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra (laughing). Thank you very much; but I am afraid nothing will\n",
      "come of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. No, Miss Petra is much more likely to take to journalism, I\n",
      "expect. By the way, have you had time to do anything with that English\n",
      "story you promised to translate for us?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. No, not yet, but you shall have it in good time.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. A discovery of mine. (Walks up and down.) Just let them\n",

      "imagination! But they will be careful what they say this time, I can\n",

      "\n",
      "Petra. But, father, tell us what it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes—only give me time, and you shall know all\n",
      "about it. If only I had Peter here now! It just shows how we men can go\n",
      "about forming our judgments, when in reality we are as blind as any\n",
      "moles—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. What are you driving at, Doctor?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (standing still by the table). Isn't it the universal\n",
      "opinion that our town is a healthy spot?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Quite an unusually healthy spot, in fact—a place that\n",
      "deserves to be recommended in the warmest possible manner either for\n",
      "invalids or for people who are well—\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, but my dear Thomas—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And we have been recommending it and praising it—I have\n",
      "written and written, both in the \"Messenger\" and in pamphlets...\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Well, what then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And the Baths—we have called them the \"main artery of\n",
      "the town's life-blood,\" the \"nerve-centre of our town,\" and the devil\n",
      "knows what else—\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. \"The town's pulsating heart\" was the expression I once used on\n",
      "an important occasion.\n",
      "\n",

      "great, splendid, much praised Baths, that have cost so much money—do\n",
      "you know what they are?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, what are they?\n",

      "\n",
      "Hovstad. But, Doctor—\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Absolutely incredible!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. The whole Bath establishment is a whited, poisoned\n",
      "sepulchre, I tell you—the gravest possible danger to the public\n",
      "health! All the nastiness up at Molledal, all that stinking filth, is\n",
      "infecting the water in the conduit-pipes leading to the reservoir; and\n",
      "the same cursed, filthy poison oozes out on the shore too—\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Where the bathing-place is?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Just there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. How do you come to be so certain of all this, Doctor?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I have investigated the matter most conscientiously. For\n",
      "a long time past I have suspected something of the kind. Last year we\n",
      "had some very strange cases of illness among the visitors—typhoid\n",
      "cases, and cases of gastric fever—\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, that is quite true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. At the time, we supposed the visitors had been infected\n",
      "before they came; but later on, in the winter, I began to have a\n",
      "different opinion; and so I set myself to examine the water, as well as\n",
      "I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Then that is what you have been so busy with?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Indeed I have been busy, Katherine. But here I had none\n",
      "of the necessary scientific apparatus; so I sent samples, both of the\n",
      "drinking-water and of the sea-water, up to the University, to have an\n",
      "accurate analysis made by a chemist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. And have you got that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (showing him the letter). Here it is! It proves the\n",
      "presence of decomposing organic matter in the water—it is full of\n",
      "infusoria. The water is absolutely dangerous to use, either internally\n",
      "or externally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. What a mercy you discovered it in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. You may well say so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. And what do you propose to do now, Doctor?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. To see the matter put right, naturally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Can that be done?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. It must be done. Otherwise the Baths will be absolutely\n",
      "useless and wasted. But we need not anticipate that; I have a very\n",
      "clear idea what we shall have to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. But why have you kept this all so secret, dear?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Do you suppose I was going to run about the town\n",
      "gossiping about it, before I had absolute proof? No, thank you. I am\n",
      "not such a fool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Still, you might have told us—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Not a living soul. But tomorrow you may run around to\n",
      "the old Badger—\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, Thomas! Thomas!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well, to your grandfather, then. The old boy will have\n",
      "something to be astonished at! I know he thinks I am cracked—and there\n",
      "are lots of other people who think so too, I have noticed. But now\n",
      "these good folks shall see—they shall just see! (Walks about, rubbing\n",
      "his hands.) There will be a nice upset in the town, Katherine; you\n",
      "can't imagine what it will be. All the conduit-pipes will have to be\n",
      "relaid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad (getting up). All the conduit-pipes—?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, of course. The intake is too low down; it will have\n",
      "to be lifted to a position much higher up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Then you were right after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Ah, you remember, Petra—I wrote opposing the plans\n",
      "before the work was begun. But at that time no one would listen to me.\n",
      "Well, I am going to let them have it now.  Of course I have prepared a\n",
      "report for the Baths Committee; I have had it ready for a week, and was\n",
      "only waiting for this to come. (Shows the letter.) Now it shall go off\n",
      "at once. (Goes into his room and comes back with some papers.) Look at\n",
      "that! Four closely written sheets!—and the letter shall go with them.\n",
      "Give me a bit of paper, Katherine—something to wrap them up in. That\n",
      "will do! Now give it to-to-(stamps his foot)—what the deuce is her\n",
      "name?—give it to the maid, and tell her to take it at once to the\n",
      "Mayor.\n",

      "(Mrs. Stockmann takes the packet and goes out through the dining-room.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. What do you think Uncle Peter will say, father?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What is there for him to say? I should think he would be\n",
      "very glad that such an important truth has been brought to light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Will you let me print a short note about your discovery in the\n",
      "\"Messenger?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I shall be very much obliged if you will.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. No, my good friends, don't let us have any of that\n",
      "nonsense. I won't hear anything of the kind. And if the Baths Committee\n",

      "Hovstad. You said yesterday that the pollution of the water was due to\n",
      "impurities in the soil.\n",

      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass\n",
      "up at Molledal.\n",

      "another morass altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What morass?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. The morass that the whole life of our town is built on and is\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What the deuce are you driving at, Hovstad?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. The whole of the town's interests have, little by little, got\n",
      "into the hands of a pack of officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Oh, come!—they are not all officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. No, but those that are not officials are at any rate the\n",
      "officials' friends and adherents; it is the wealthy folk, the old\n",
      "families in the town, that have got us entirely in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, but after all they are men of ability and knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Did they show any ability or knowledge when they laid the\n",
      "conduit pipes where they are now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. No, of course that was a great piece of stupidity on\n",
      "their part. But that is going to be set right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Do you think that will be all such plain sailing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Plain sailing or no, it has got to be done, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes, provided the press takes up the question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I don't think that will be necessary, my dear fellow, I\n",
      "am certain my brother—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Excuse me, doctor; I feel bound to tell you I am inclined to\n",
      "take the matter up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. In the paper?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes. When I took over the \"People's Messenger\" my idea was to\n",
      "break up this ring of self-opinionated old fossils who had got hold of\n",
      "all the influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But you know you told me yourself what the result had\n",
      "been; you nearly ruined your paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes, at the time we were obliged to climb down a peg or two,\n",
      "it is quite true—because there was a danger of the whole project of\n",
      "the Baths coming to nothing if they failed us. But now the scheme has\n",
      "been carried through, and we can dispense with these grand gentlemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Dispense with them, yes; but, we owe them a great debt\n",
      "of gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. That shall be recognised ungrudgingly, But a journalist of my\n",
      "democratic tendencies cannot let such an opportunity as this slip. The\n",
      "bubble of official infallibility must be pricked. This superstition\n",
      "must be destroyed, like any other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I am whole-heartedly with you in that, Mr. Hovstad; if\n",
      "it is a superstition, away with it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. I should be very reluctant to bring the Mayor into it, because\n",
      "he is your brother. But I am sure you will agree with me that truth\n",
      "should be the first consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. That goes without saying. (With sudden emphasis.) Yes,\n",
      "but—but—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. You must not misjudge me. I am neither more self-interested\n",
      "nor more ambitious than most men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. My dear fellow—who suggests anything of the kind?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. I am of humble origin, as you know; and that has given me\n",
      "opportunities of knowing what is the most crying need in the humbler\n",
      "ranks of life. It is that they should be allowed some part in the\n",
      "direction of public affairs, Doctor. That is what will develop their\n",
      "faculties and intelligence and self respect—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I quite appreciate that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes—and in my opinion a journalist incurs a heavy\n",
      "responsibility if he neglects a favourable opportunity of emancipating\n",
      "the masses—the humble and oppressed. I know well enough that in\n",
      "exalted circles I shall be called an agitator, and all that sort of\n",
      "thing; but they may call what they like. If only my conscience doesn't\n",
      "reproach me, then—\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I shall be very grateful to you, but—\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Because it may be no bad thing to have us small tradesmen at\n",
      "your back. We form, as it were, a compact majority in the town—if we\n",
      "choose. And it is always a good thing to have the majority with you,\n",
      "Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. That is undeniably true; but I confess I don't see why\n",
      "such unusual precautions should be necessary in this case. It seems to\n",
      "me that such a plain, straightforward thing—\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Oh, it may be very desirable, all the same. I know our local\n",
      "authorities so well; officials are not generally very ready to act on\n",
      "proposals that come from other people. That is why I think it would not\n",
      "be at all amiss if we made a little demonstration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. That's right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Demonstration, did you say? What on earth are you going\n",
      "to make a demonstration about?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. We shall proceed with the greatest moderation, Doctor.\n",
      "Moderation is always my aim; it is the greatest virtue in a citizen—at\n",
      "least, I think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. It is well known to be a characteristic of yours, Mr.\n",
      "Aslaksen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Yes, I think I may pride myself on that. And this matter of\n",
      "the water supply is of the greatest importance to us small tradesmen.\n",
      "The Baths promise to be a regular gold-mine for the town. We shall all\n",
      "make our living out of them, especially those of us who are\n",
      "householders. That is why we will back up the project as strongly as\n",
      "possible. And as I am at present Chairman of the Householders'\n",

      "cause?\n",

      "Dr. Stockmann. Of course, of course.\n",
      "\n",

      "great many people. And as I have the reputation of a temperate and\n",

      "scarcely say that it would have to be drawn up with the greatest regard\n",
      "to moderation, so as not to offend the authorities—who, after all,\n",

      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Well, and even supposing they didn't like it—\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. No, no, no; there must be no discourtesy to the authorities,\n",
      "Mr. Hovstad. It is no use falling foul of those upon whom our welfare\n",
      "so closely depends. I have done that in my time, and no good ever comes\n",

      "Aslaksen. No, thank you; I never drink alcohol of that kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well, what do you say to a glass of beer, then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Nor that either, thank you, Doctor. I never drink anything as\n",
      "early as this. I am going into town now to talk this over with one or\n",
      "two householders, and prepare the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. It is tremendously kind of you, Mr. Aslaksen; but I\n",
      "really cannot understand the necessity for all these precautions. It\n",
      "seems to me that the thing should go of itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. The authorities are somewhat slow to move, Doctor. Far be it\n",
      "from me to seem to blame them—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. We are going to stir them up in the paper tomorrow, Aslaksen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. But not violently, I trust, Mr. Hovstad. Proceed with\n",
      "moderation, or you will do nothing with them. You may take my advice; I\n",
      "have gathered my experience in the school of life. Well, I must say\n",
      "goodbye, Doctor. You know now that we small tradesmen are at your back\n",
      "at all events, like a solid wall. You have the compact majority on your\n",
      "side Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I am very much obliged, dear Mr. Aslaksen, (Shakes hands\n",
      "with him.) Goodbye, goodbye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Are you going my way, towards the printing-office. Mr.\n",
      "Hovstad?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad, I will come later; I have something to settle up first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Very well. (Bows and goes out; STOCKMANN follows him into the\n",
      "hall.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad (as STOCKMANN comes in again). Well, what do you think of that,\n",
      "Doctor? Don't you think it is high time we stirred a little life into\n",
      "all this slackness and vacillation and cowardice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Are you referring to Aslaksen?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad, Yes, I am. He is one of those who are floundering in a\n",
      "bog—decent enough fellow though he may be, otherwise. And most of the\n",
      "people here are in just the same case—see-sawing and edging first to\n",
      "one side and then to the other, so overcome with caution and scruple\n",
      "that they never dare to take any decided step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann, Yes, but Aslaksen seemed to me so thoroughly\n",
      "well-intentioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. There is one thing I esteem higher than that; and that is for\n",
      "a man to be self-reliant and sure of himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I think you are perfectly right there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. That is why I want to seize this opportunity, and try if I\n",
      "cannot manage to put a little virility into these well-intentioned\n",
      "people for once. The idol of Authority must be shattered in this town.\n",
      "This gross and inexcusable blunder about the water supply must be\n",
      "brought home to the mind of every municipal voter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Very well; if you are of opinion that it is for the good\n",
      "of the community, so be it. But not until I have had a talk with my\n",
      "brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Anyway, I will get a leading article ready; and if the Mayor\n",
      "refuses to take the matter up—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. How can you suppose such a thing possible!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. It is conceivable. And in that case—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. In that case I promise you—. Look here, in that case\n",
      "you may print my report—every word of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. May I? Have I your word for it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (giving him the MS.). Here it is; take it with you. It\n",
      "can do no harm for you to read it through, and you can give it me back\n",
      "later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Good, good! That is what I will do. And now goodbye, Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Goodbye, goodbye. You will see everything will run quite\n",
      "smoothly, Mr. Hovstad—quite smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Hm!—we shall see. (Bows and goes out.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (opens the dining-room door and looks in). Katherine! Oh,\n",
      "you are back, Petra?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra (coming in). Yes, I have just come from the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann (coming in). Has he not been here yet?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Peter? No, but I have had a long talk with Hovstad. He\n",
      "is quite excited about my discovery, I find it has a much wider bearing\n",
      "than I at first imagined. And he has put his paper at my disposal if\n",
      "necessity should arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Do you think it will?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Not for a moment. But at all events it makes me feel\n",
      "proud to know that I have the liberal-minded independent press on my\n",
      "side. Yes, and just imagine—I have had a visit from the Chairman of\n",
      "the Householders' Association!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Oh! What did he want?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. To offer me his support too. They will support me in a\n",
      "body if it should be necessary. Katherine—do you know what I have got\n",
      "behind me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Behind you? No, what have you got behind you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. The compact majority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Really? Is that a good thing for you Thomas?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I should think it was a good thing. (Walks up and down\n",
      "rubbing his hands.) By Jove, it's a fine thing to feel this bond of\n",
      "brotherhood between oneself and one's fellow citizens!\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. And to be able to do so much that is good and useful, father!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And for one's own native town into the bargain, my child!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. That was a ring at the bell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. It must be he, then. (A knock is heard at the door.)\n",
      "Come in!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann (comes in from the hall). Good morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Glad to see you, Peter!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Good morning, Peter, How are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. So so, thank you. (To DR. STOCKMANN.) I received from\n",
      "you yesterday, after office hours, a report dealing with the condition\n",
      "of the water at the Baths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes. Have you read it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, I have,\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And what have you to say to it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann (with a sidelong glance). Hm!—\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Come along, Petra. (She and PETRA go into the room on\n",
      "the left.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann (after a pause). Was it necessary to make all these\n",
      "investigations behind my back?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, because until I was absolutely certain about it—\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Then you mean that you are absolutely certain now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Surely you are convinced of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Is it your intention to bring this document before the\n",
      "Baths Committee as a sort of official communication?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Certainly. Something must be done in the matter—and\n",
      "that quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. As usual, you employ violent expressions in your\n",
      "report. You say, amongst other things, that what we offer visitors in\n",
      "our Baths is a permanent supply of poison.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well, can you describe it any other way, Peter? Just\n",
      "think—water that is poisonous, whether you drink it or bathe in it!\n",
      "And this we offer to the poor sick folk who come to us trustfully and\n",
      "pay us at an exorbitant rate to be made well again!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. And your reasoning leads you to this conclusion, that\n",
      "we must build a sewer to draw off the alleged impurities from Molledal\n",
      "and must relay the water conduits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes. Do you see any other way out of it? I don't.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I made a pretext this morning to go and see the town\n",
      "engineer, and, as if only half seriously, broached the subject of these\n",
      "proposals as a thing we might perhaps have to take under consideration\n",
      "some time later on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Some time later on!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. He smiled at what he considered to be my extravagance,\n",
      "naturally. Have you taken the trouble to consider what your proposed\n",
      "alterations would cost? According to the information I obtained, the\n",
      "expenses would probably mount up to fifteen or twenty thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Would it cost so much?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes; and the worst part of it would be that the work\n",
      "would take at least two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Two years? Two whole years?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. At least. And what are we to do with the Baths in the\n",
      "meantime? Close them? Indeed we should be obliged to. And do you\n",
      "suppose anyone would come near the place after it had got out that the\n",
      "water was dangerous?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes but, Peter, that is what it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. And all this at this juncture—just as the Baths are\n",
      "beginning to be known. There are other towns in the neighbourhood with\n",
      "qualifications to attract visitors for bathing purposes. Don't you\n",
      "suppose they would immediately strain every nerve to divert the entire\n",
      "stream of strangers to themselves? Unquestionably they would; and then\n",
      "where should we be? We should probably have to abandon the whole thing,\n",
      "which has cost us so much money-and then you would have ruined your\n",
      "native town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I—should have ruined—!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. It is simply and solely through the Baths that the\n",
      "town has before it any future worth mentioning. You know that just as\n",
      "well as I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But what do you think ought to be done, then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Your report has not convinced me that the condition of\n",
      "the water at the Baths is as bad as you represent it to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I tell you it is even worse!—or at all events it will\n",
      "be in summer, when the warm weather comes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. As I said, I believe you exaggerate the matter\n",
      "considerably. A capable physician ought to know what measures to\n",
      "take—he ought to be capable of preventing injurious influences or of\n",
      "remedying them if they become obviously persistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well? What more?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. The water supply for the Baths is now an established\n",
      "fact, and in consequence must be treated as such. But probably the\n",
      "Committee, at its discretion, will not be disinclined to consider the\n",
      "question of how far it might be possible to introduce certain\n",
      "improvements consistently with a reasonable expenditure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And do you suppose that I will have anything to do with\n",
      "such a piece of trickery as that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Trickery!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, it would be a trick—a fraud, a lie, a downright\n",
      "crime towards the public, towards the whole community!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I have not, as I remarked before, been able to\n",
      "convince myself that there is actually any imminent danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. You have! It is impossible that you should not be\n",
      "convinced. I know I have represented the facts absolutely truthfully\n",
      "and fairly. And you know it very well, Peter, only you won't\n",
      "acknowledge it. It was owing to your action that both the Baths and the\n",
      "water conduits were built where they are; and that is what you won't\n",
      "acknowledge—that damnable blunder of yours. Pooh!—do you suppose I\n",
      "don't see through you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. And even if that were true? If I perhaps guard my\n",
      "reputation somewhat anxiously, it is in the interests of the town.\n",
      "Without moral authority I am powerless to direct public affairs as\n",
      "seems, to my judgment, to be best for the common good. And on that\n",
      "account—and for various other reasons too—it appears to me to be a\n",
      "matter of importance that your report should not be delivered to the\n",
      "Committee. In the interests of the public, you must withhold it. Then,\n",
      "later on, I will raise the question and we will do our best, privately;\n",
      "but nothing of this unfortunate affair not a single word of it—must\n",
      "come to the ears of the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I am afraid you will not be able to prevent that now, my\n",
      "dear Peter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. It must and shall be prevented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. It is no use, I tell you. There are too many people that\n",
      "know about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. That know about it? Who? Surely you don't mean those\n",
      "fellows on the \"People's Messenger\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, they know. The liberal-minded independent press is\n",
      "going to see that you do your duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann (after a short pause). You are an extraordinarily\n",
      "independent man, Thomas. Have you given no thought to the consequences\n",
      "this may have for yourself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Consequences?—for me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. For you and yours, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What the deuce do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I believe I have always behaved in a brotherly way to\n",
      "you—haven't I always been ready to oblige or to help you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, you have, and I am grateful to you for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. There is no need. Indeed, to some extent I was forced\n",
      "to do so—for my own sake. I always hoped that, if I helped to improve\n",
      "your financial position, I should be able to keep some check on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What! Then it was only for your own sake—!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Up to a certain point, yes. It is painful for a man in\n",
      "an official position to have his nearest relative compromising himself\n",
      "time after time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And do you consider that I do that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, unfortunately, you do, without even being aware\n",
      "of it. You have a restless, pugnacious, rebellious disposition. And\n",
      "then there is that disastrous propensity of yours to want to write\n",
      "about every sort of possible and impossible thing. The moment an idea\n",
      "comes into your head, you must needs go and write a newspaper article\n",
      "or a whole pamphlet about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well, but is it not the duty of a citizen to let the\n",
      "public share in any new ideas he may have?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Oh, the public doesn't require any new ideas. The\n",
      "public is best served by the good, old established ideas it already has.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And that is your honest opinion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, and for once I must talk frankly to you. Hitherto\n",
      "I have tried to avoid doing so, because I know how irritable you are;\n",
      "but now I must tell you the truth, Thomas. You have no conception what\n",
      "an amount of harm you do yourself by your impetuosity. You complain of\n",
      "the authorities, you even complain of the government—you are always\n",
      "pulling them to pieces; you insist that you have been neglected and\n",
      "persecuted. But what else can such a cantankerous man as you expect?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What next! Cantankerous, am I?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, Thomas, you are an extremely cantankerous man to\n",
      "work with—I know that to my cost. You disregard everything that you\n",
      "ought to have consideration for. You seem completely to forget that it\n",
      "is me you have to thank for your appointment here as medical officer to\n",
      "the Baths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I was entitled to it as a matter of course!—I and\n",
      "nobody else! I was the first person to see that the town could be made\n",
      "into a flourishing watering-place, and I was the only one who saw it at\n",
      "that time. I had to fight single-handed in support of the idea for many\n",
      "years; and I wrote and wrote—\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Undoubtedly. But things were not ripe for the scheme\n",
      "then—though, of course, you could not judge of that in your\n",
      "out-of-the-way corner up north. But as soon as the opportune moment\n",
      "came I—and the others—took the matter into our hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and made this mess of all my beautiful plan. It is\n",
      "pretty obvious now what clever fellows you were!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. To my mind the whole thing only seems to mean that you\n",
      "are seeking another outlet for your combativeness. You want to pick a\n",
      "quarrel with your superiors—an old habit of yours. You cannot put up\n",
      "with any authority over you. You look askance at anyone who occupies a\n",
      "superior official position; you regard him as a personal enemy, and\n",
      "then any stick is good enough to beat him with. But now I have called\n",
      "your attention to the fact that the town's interests are at stake—and,\n",
      "incidentally, my own too. And therefore, I must tell you, Thomas, that\n",
      "you will find me inexorable with regard to what I am about to require\n",
      "you to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And what is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. As you have been so indiscreet as to speak of this\n",
      "delicate matter to outsiders, despite the fact that you ought to have\n",
      "treated it as entirely official and confidential, it is obviously\n",
      "impossible to hush it up now. All sorts of rumours will get about\n",
      "directly, and everybody who has a grudge against us will take care to\n",
      "embellish these rumours. So it will be necessary for you to refute them\n",
      "publicly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I! How? I don't understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. What we shall expect is that, after making further\n",
      "investigations, you will come to the conclusion that the matter is not\n",
      "by any means as dangerous or as critical as you imagined in the first\n",
      "instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Oho!—so that is what you expect!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. And, what is more, we shall expect you to make public\n",
      "profession of your confidence in the Committee and in their readiness\n",
      "to consider fully and conscientiously what steps may be necessary to\n",
      "remedy any possible defects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But you will never be able to do that by patching and\n",
      "tinkering at it—never! Take my word for it, Peter; I mean what I say,\n",
      "as deliberately and emphatically as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. As an officer under the Committee, you have no right\n",
      "to any individual opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (amazed). No right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. In your official capacity, no. As a private person, it\n",
      "is quite another matter. But as a subordinate member of the staff of\n",
      "the Baths, you have no right to express any opinion which runs contrary\n",
      "to that of your superiors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. This is too much! I, a doctor, a man of science, have no\n",
      "right to—!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. The matter in hand is not simply a scientific one. It\n",
      "is a complicated matter, and has its economic as well as its technical\n",
      "side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I don't care what it is! I intend to be free to express\n",
      "my opinion on any subject under the sun.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Timid? Yes, when it is a question of the local authorities, I\n",
      "am timid, Mr. Billing; it is a lesson I have learned in the school of\n",

      "that concern the government itself, and then see if I am timid.\n",

      "anyway; those fellows pay no attention to attacks, you see—they go on\n",
      "just as they are, in spite of them. But local authorities are\n",
      "different; they can be turned out, and then perhaps you may get an\n",

      "the Bench either, if I were you; for I can assure you—you won't get it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Billing. Do you think I am not quite aware of that? My object is\n",
      "precisely not to get it. A slight of that kind stimulates a man's\n",
      "fighting power—it is like getting a supply of fresh bile—and I am\n",
      "sure one needs that badly enough in a hole-and-corner place like this,\n",

      "\n",
      "Petra. Quite so. That is why I wanted to tell you that you must find\n",
      "something else. (Lays the book on the table.) You can't use this for\n",
      "the \"People's Messenger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Why not?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Oh, for that matter—\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. You don't understand me. The burden of this story is that there\n",
      "is a supernatural power that looks after the so-called good people in\n",
      "this world and makes everything happen for the best in their\n",
      "case—while all the so-called bad people are punished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Well, but that is all right. That is just what our readers\n",
      "want.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. And are you going to be the one to give it to them? For myself,\n",
      "I do not believe a word of it. You know quite well that things do not\n",
      "happen so in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. You are perfectly right; but an editor cannot always act as he\n",
      "would prefer. He is often obliged to bow to the wishes of the public in\n",
      "unimportant matters. Politics are the most important thing in life—for\n",
      "a newspaper, anyway; and if I want to carry my public with me on the\n",

      "If they find a moral tale of this sort in the serial at the bottom of\n",

      "\n",
      "Hovstad (smiling). Thank you for having such a good opinion of me. No;\n",

      "\n",
      "Petra. Billing's!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes; anyway, he propounded that theory here one day. And it is\n",
      "Billing who is so anxious to have that story in the paper; I don't know\n",
      "anything about the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. But how can Billing, with his emancipated views—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Oh, Billing is a many-sided man. He is applying for the post\n",
      "of secretary to the Bench, too, I hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. I don't believe it, Mr. Hovstad. How could he possibly bring\n",

      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Ah, you must ask him that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. I should never have thought it of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad (looking more closely at her). No? Does it really surprise you\n",
      "so much?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Yes. Or perhaps not altogether. Really, I don't quite know\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. We journalists are not much worth, Miss Stockmann.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Do you really mean that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. I think so sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Yes, in the ordinary affairs of everyday life, perhaps; I can\n",
      "understand that. But now, when you have taken a weighty matter in hand—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. This matter of your father's, you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Exactly. It seems to me that now you must feel you are a man\n",
      "worth more than most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes, today I do feel something of that sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Of course you do, don't you? It is a splendid vocation you have\n",
      "chosen—to smooth the way for the march of unappreciated truths, and\n",
      "new and courageous lines of thought. If it were nothing more than\n",
      "because you stand fearlessly in the open and take up the cause of an\n",
      "injured man—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Especially when that injured man is—ahem!—I don't rightly\n",
      "know how to—\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. When that man is so upright and so honest, you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad (more gently). Especially when he is your father I meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra (suddenly checked). That?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Yes, Petra—Miss Petra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Is it that, that is first and foremost with you? Not the matter\n",
      "itself? Not the truth?—not my father's big generous heart?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Certainly—of course—that too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. No, thank you; you have betrayed yourself, Mr. Hovstad, and now\n",
      "I shall never trust you again in anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Can you really take it so amiss in me that it is mostly for\n",
      "your sake—?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. What I am angry with you for, is for not having been honest with\n",
      "my father. You talked to him as if the truth and the good of the\n",
      "community were what lay nearest to your heart. You have made fools of\n",
      "both my father and me. You are not the man you made yourself out to be.\n",
      "And that I shall never forgive you-never!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. You ought not to speak so bitterly, Miss Petra—least of all\n",
      "now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Why not now, especially?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Because your father cannot do without my help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra (looking him up and down). Are you that sort of man too? For\n",
      "shame!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. No, no, I am not. This came upon me so unexpectedly—you must\n",
      "believe that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. I know what to believe. Goodbye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen (coming from the printing room, hurriedly and with an air of\n",
      "mystery). Damnation, Hovstad!—(Sees PETRA.) Oh, this is awkward—\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. There is the book; you must give it to some one else. (Goes\n",
      "towards the door.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad (following her). But, Miss Stockmann—\n",

      "Aslaksen. The Mayor is outside in the printing room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. The Mayor, did you say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Yes he wants to speak to you. He came in by the back\n",
      "door—didn't want to be seen, you understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. What can he want? Wait a bit—I will go myself. (Goes to the\n",
      "door of the printing room, opens it, bows and invites PETER STOCKMANN\n",
      "in.) Just see, Aslaksen, that no one—\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Quite so. (Goes into the printing-room.)\n",
      "\n",

      "indeed.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. And here I come, without any notice, to take up your\n",
      "time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. By all means, Mr. Mayor. I am at your service. But let me\n",
      "relieve you of your—(takes STOCKMANN's hat and stick and puts them on\n",
      "a chair). Won't you sit down?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann (sitting down by the table). Thank you. (HOVSTAD sits\n",
      "down.) I have had an extremely annoying experience to-day, Mr. Hovstad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Really? Ah well, I expect with all the various business you\n",
      "have to attend to—\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. The Medical Officer of the Baths is responsible for\n",
      "what happened today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Indeed? The Doctor?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. He has addressed a kind of report to the Baths\n",
      "Committee on the subject of certain supposed defects in the Baths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Has he indeed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes—has he not told you? I thought he said—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Ah, yes—it is true he did mention something about—\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen (coming from the printing-room). I ought to have that copy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad (angrily). Ahem!—there it is on the desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen (taking it). Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. But look there—that is the thing I was speaking of!\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Yes, that is the Doctor's article, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Oh, is THAT what you were speaking about?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, that is it. What do you think of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Oh, I am only a layman—and I have only taken a very cursory\n",
      "glance at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. But you are going to print it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. I cannot very well refuse a distinguished man.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. I merely print what is put into my hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Quite so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. And so I must— (moves off towards the printing-room).\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. No, but wait a moment, Mr. Aslaksen. You will allow\n",
      "me, Mr. Hovstad?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. If you please, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. You are a discreet and thoughtful man, Mr. Aslaksen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. I am delighted to hear you think so, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. And a man of very considerable influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Chiefly among the small tradesmen, sir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. The small tax-payers are the majority—here as\n",
      "everywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. That is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. And I have no doubt you know the general trend of\n",
      "opinion among them, don't you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Yes I think I may say I do, Mr. Mayor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes. Well, since there is such a praiseworthy spirit\n",
      "of self-sacrifice among the less wealthy citizens of our town—\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. What?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Self-sacrifice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. It is pleasing evidence of a public-spirited feeling,\n",
      "extremely pleasing evidence. I might almost say I hardly expected it.\n",
      "But you have a closer knowledge of public opinion than I.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. But, Mr. Mayor—\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. And indeed it is no small sacrifice that the town is\n",
      "going to make.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. The town?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. But I don't understand. Is it the Baths—?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. At a provisional estimate, the alterations that the\n",
      "Medical Officer asserts to be desirable will cost somewhere about\n",
      "twenty thousand pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. That is a lot of money, but—\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Of course it will be necessary to raise a municipal\n",
      "loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad (getting up). Surely you never mean that the town must pay—?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Do you mean that it must come out of the municipal\n",
      "funds?—out of the ill-filled pockets of the small tradesmen?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Well, my dear Mr. Aslaksen, where else is the money to\n",
      "come from?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. The gentlemen who own the Baths ought to provide that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. The proprietors of the Baths are not in a position to\n",
      "incur any further expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Is that absolutely certain, Mr. Mayor?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I have satisfied myself that it is so. If the town\n",
      "wants these very extensive alterations, it will have to pay for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. But, damn it all—I beg your pardon—this is quite another\n",
      "matter, Mr. Hovstad!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. It is, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. The most fatal part of it is that we shall be obliged\n",
      "to shut the Baths for a couple of years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Shut them? Shut them altogether?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. For two years?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, the work will take as long as that—at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. I'm damned if we will stand that, Mr. Mayor! What are we\n",
      "householders to live upon in the meantime?\n",
      "\n",

      "hearing soft voices and music. Do you not think that the poodle's brain\n",

      "Dr. Stockmann (standing still). What a strange woman you are,\n",
      "Katherine! Would you prefer to have the boys grow up in a society like\n",
      "this? You saw for yourself last night that half the population are out\n",

      "so I got my notice.\n",

      "Dr. Stockmann. Well?\n",

      "\n",

      "names, Katherine!\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. And two of them were to the effect that a man, who has been our\n",
      "guest here, was declaring last night at the Club that my views on\n",
      "various subjects are extremely emancipated—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. You did not deny that, I hope?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. No, you know I wouldn't. Mrs. Busk's own views are tolerably\n",
      "emancipated, when we are alone together; but now that this report about\n",
      "me is being spread, she dare not keep me on any longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. And someone who had been a guest of ours! That shows\n",
      "you the return you get for your hospitality, Thomas!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. We won't live in such a disgusting hole any longer. Pack\n",
      "up as quickly as you can, Katherine; the sooner we can get away, the\n",
      "better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Be quiet—I think I hear someone in the hall. See who\n",
      "it is, Petra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra (opening the door). Oh, it's you, Captain Horster! Do come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster (coming in). Good morning. I thought I would just come in and\n",
      "see how you were.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (shaking his hand). Thanks—that is really kind of you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. And thank you, too, for helping us through the crowd,\n",
      "Captain Horster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. How did you manage to get home again?\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Oh, somehow or other. I am fairly strong, and there is more\n",
      "sound than fury about these folk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, isn't their swinish cowardice astonishing? Look\n",
      "here, I will show you something! There are all the stones they have\n",
      "thrown through my windows. Just look at them! I'm hanged if there are\n",
      "more than two decently large bits of hard stone in the whole heap; the\n",
      "rest are nothing but gravel—wretched little things. And yet they stood\n",
      "out there bawling and swearing that they would do me some violence; but\n",
      "as for doing anything—you don't see much of that in this town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Just as well for you this time, doctor!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. True enough. But it makes one angry all the same;\n",
      "because if some day it should be a question of a national fight in real\n",
      "earnest, you will see that public opinion will be in favour of taking\n",
      "to one's heels, and the compact majority will turn tail like a flock of\n",
      "sheep, Captain Horster. That is what is so mournful to think of; it\n",
      "gives me so much concern, that—. No, devil take it, it is ridiculous\n",
      "to care about it! They have called me an enemy of the people, so an\n",
      "enemy of the people let me be!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. You will never be that, Thomas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Don't swear to that, Katherine. To be called an ugly\n",
      "name may have the same effect as a pin-scratch in the lung. And that\n",
      "hateful name—I can't get quit of it. It is sticking here in the pit of\n",
      "my stomach, eating into me like a corrosive acid. And no magnesia will\n",
      "remove it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Bah!—you should only laugh at them, father,\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. They will change their minds some day, Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, Thomas, as sure as you are standing here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Perhaps, when it is too late. Much good may it do them!\n",
      "They may wallow in their filth then and rue the day when they drove a\n",
      "patriot into exile. When do you sail, Captain Horster?\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Hm!—that was just what I had come to speak about—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Why, has anything gone wrong with the ship?\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. No; but what has happened is that I am not to sail in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. Do you mean that you have been dismissed from your command?\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster (smiling). Yes, that's just it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. You too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. There, you see, Thomas!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And that for the truth's sake! Oh, if I had thought such\n",
      "a thing possible—\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. You mustn't take it to heart; I shall be sure to find a job\n",
      "with some ship-owner or other, elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And that is this man Vik—a wealthy man, independent of\n",
      "everyone and everything—! Shame on him!\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. He is quite an excellent fellow otherwise; he told me himself\n",
      "he would willingly have kept me on, if only he had dared—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But he didn't dare? No, of course not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. It is not such an easy matter, he said, for a party man—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. The worthy man spoke the truth. A party is like a\n",
      "sausage machine; it mashes up all sorts of heads together into the same\n",
      "mincemeat—fatheads and blockheads, all in one mash!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Come, come, Thomas dear!\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra (to HORSTER). If only you had not come home with us, things might\n",
      "not have come to this pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. I do not regret it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra (holding out her hand to him). Thank you for that!\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster (to DR. STOCKMANN). And so what I came to say was that if you\n",
      "are determined to go away, I have thought of another plan—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. That's splendid!—if only we can get away at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Hush!—wasn't that some one knocking?\n",
      "\n",
      "Petra. That is uncle, surely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Aha! (Calls out.) Come in!\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Dear Thomas, promise me definitely—. (PETER STOCKMANN\n",

      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Oh, you are engaged. In that case, I will—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. No, no, come in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. But I wanted to speak to you alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. We will go into the sitting-room in the meanwhile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. And I will look in again later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. No, go in there with them, Captain Horster; I want to\n",
      "hear more about—.\n",
      "\n",
      "Horster. Very well, I will wait, then. (He follows MRS. STOCKMANN and\n",
      "PETRA into the sitting-room.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I daresay you find it rather draughty here today. Put\n",
      "your hat on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Thank you, if I may. (Does so.) I think I caught cold\n",
      "last night; I stood and shivered—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Really? I found it warm enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I regret that it was not in my power to prevent those\n",
      "excesses last night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Have you anything in particular to say to me besides\n",
      "that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann (taking a big letter from his pocket). I have this\n",
      "document for you, from the Baths Committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. My dismissal?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Yes, dating from today. (Lays the letter on the\n",
      "table.) It gives us pain to do it; but, to speak frankly, we dared not\n",
      "do otherwise on account of public opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (smiling). Dared not? I seem to have heard that word\n",
      "before, today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I must beg you to understand your position clearly.\n",
      "For the future you must not count on any practice whatever in the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Devil take the practice! But why are you so sure of that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. The Householders' Association is circulating a list\n",
      "from house to house. All right-minded citizens are being called upon to\n",
      "give up employing you; and I can assure you that not a single head of a\n",
      "family will risk refusing his signature. They simply dare not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. No, no; I don't doubt it. But what then?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. If I might advise you, it would be best to leave the\n",
      "place for a little while—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, the propriety of leaving the place has occurred to\n",
      "me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Good. And then, when you have had six months to think\n",
      "things over, if, after mature consideration, you can persuade yourself\n",
      "to write a few words of regret, acknowledging your error—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I might have my appointment restored to me, do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Perhaps. It is not at all impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But what about public opinion, then? Surely you would\n",
      "not dare to do it on account of public feeling...\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Public opinion is an extremely mutable thing. And, to\n",
      "be quite candid with you, it is a matter of great importance to us to\n",
      "have some admission of that sort from you in writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Oh, that's what you are after, is it! I will just\n",
      "trouble you to remember what I said to you lately about foxy tricks of\n",
      "that sort!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Your position was quite different then. At that time\n",
      "you had reason to suppose you had the whole town at your back—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and now I feel I have the whole town ON my\n",
      "back—(flaring up). I would not do it if I had the devil and his dam on\n",
      "my back—! Never—never, I tell you!\n",

      "You have no right to do it, Thomas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I have no right! There is only one single thing in the\n",

      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Of course you don't, but I will tell you. A free man has\n",
      "no right to soil himself with filth; he has no right to behave in a way\n",
      "that would justify his spitting in his own face.\n",

      "course; and if there were no other explanation for your obstinacy—.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. You understand, very well what I mean. But, as your\n",
      "brother and as a man of discretion, I advise you not to build too much\n",
      "upon expectations and prospects that may so very easily fail you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What in the world is all this about?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Do you really ask me to believe that you are ignorant\n",
      "of the terms of Mr. Kiil's will?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I know that the small amount he possesses is to go to an\n",
      "institution for indigent old workpeople. How does that concern me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. In the first place, it is by no means a small amount\n",
      "that is in question. Mr. Kiil is a fairly wealthy man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I had no notion of that!\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. Hm!—hadn't you really? Then I suppose you had no\n",
      "notion, either, that a considerable portion of his wealth will come to\n",
      "your children, you and your wife having a life-rent of the capital. Has\n",
      "he never told you so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Never, on my honour! Quite the reverse; he has\n",
      "consistently done nothing but fume at being so unconscionably heavily\n",
      "taxed. But are you perfectly certain of this, Peter?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I have it from an absolutely reliable source.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But he won't do that, my dear Peter. The \"Badger\" is\n",
      "much too delighted at my attack on you and your wise friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann (starts and looks intently at him). Ah, that throws a\n",
      "light on various things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What things?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I see that the whole thing was a combined manoeuvre on\n",
      "your part and his. These violent, reckless attacks that you have made\n",
      "against the leading men of the town, under the pretence that it was in\n",
      "the name of truth—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. What about them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Peter Stockmann. I see that they were nothing else than the stipulated\n",
      "price for that vindictive old man's will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (almost speechless). Peter—you are the most disgusting\n",

      "\n",

      "What can I do for you? Won't you sit down?\n",

      "Morten Kiil. I won't sit. (Looks around.) You look very comfortable\n",
      "here today, Thomas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, don't we!\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. Very comfortable—plenty of fresh air. I should think you\n",
      "have got enough to-day of that oxygen you were talking about yesterday.\n",
      "Your conscience must be in splendid order to-day, I should think.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. It is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. So I should think. (Taps his chest.) Do you know what I\n",
      "have got here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. A good conscience, too, I hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. Bah!—No, it is something better than that. (He takes a\n",
      "thick pocket-book from his breast-pocket, opens it, and displays a\n",
      "packet of papers.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (looking at him in astonishment). Shares in the Baths?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. They were not difficult to get today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And you have been buying—?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. As many as I could pay for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But, my dear Mr. Kiil—consider the state of the Baths'\n",
      "affairs!\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. If you behave like a reasonable man, you can soon set the\n",
      "Baths on their feet again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well, you can see for yourself that I have done all I\n",
      "can, but—. They are all mad in this town!\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. You said yesterday that the worst of this pollution came\n",
      "from my tannery. If that is true, then my grandfather and my father\n",
      "before me, and I myself, for many years past, have been poisoning the\n",
      "town like three destroying angels. Do you think I am going to sit quiet\n",
      "under that reproach?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Unfortunately I am afraid you will have to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. No, thank you. I am jealous of my name and reputation.\n",
      "They call me \"the Badger,\" I am told. A badger is a kind of pig, I\n",
      "believe; but I am not going to give them the right to call me that. I\n",
      "mean to live and die a clean man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And how are you going to set about it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. You shall cleanse me, Thomas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I!\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. Do you know what money I have bought these shares with?\n",
      "No, of course you can't know—but I will tell you. It is the money that\n",
      "Katherine and Petra and the boys will have when I am gone. Because I\n",
      "have been able to save a little bit after all, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (flaring up). And you have gone and taken Katherine's\n",
      "money for this!\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. Yes, the whole of the money is invested in the Baths now.\n",
      "And now I just want to see whether you are quite stark, staring mad,\n",
      "Thomas! If you still make out that these animals and other nasty things\n",
      "of that sort come from my tannery, it will be exactly as if you were to\n",
      "flay broad strips of skin from Katherine's body, and Petra's, and the\n",
      "boys'; and no decent man would do that—unless he were mad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (walking up and down). Yes, but I am mad; I am mad!\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. You cannot be so absurdly mad as all that, when it is a\n",
      "question of your wife and children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (standing still in front of him). Why couldn't you\n",
      "consult me about it, before you went and bought all that trash?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. What is done cannot be undone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (walks about uneasily). If only I were not so certain\n",
      "about it—! But I am absolutely convinced that I am right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil (weighing the pocket-book in his hand). If you stick to\n",
      "your mad idea, this won't be worth much, you know. (Puts the\n",
      "pocket-book in his pocket.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But, hang it all! It might be possible for science to\n",
      "discover some prophylactic, I should think—or some antidote of some\n",
      "kind—\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. To kill these animals, do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, or to make them innocuous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. Couldn't you try some rat's-bane?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Don't talk nonsense! They all say it is only\n",
      "imagination, you know. Well, let it go at that! Let them have their own\n",
      "way about it! Haven't the ignorant, narrow-minded curs reviled me as an\n",
      "enemy of the people?—and haven't they been ready to tear the clothes\n",
      "off my back too?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. And broken all your windows to pieces!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And then there is my duty to my family. I must talk it\n",
      "over with Katherine; she is great on those things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. That is right; be guided by a reasonable woman's advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (advancing towards him). To think you could do such a\n",
      "preposterous thing!  Risking Katherine's money in this way, and putting\n",
      "me in such a horribly painful dilemma! When I look at you, I think I\n",
      "see the devil himself—.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. Then I had better go. But I must have an answer from you\n",
      "before two o'clock—yes or no. If it is no, the shares go to a charity,\n",
      "and that this very day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. And what does Katherine get?\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil. Not a halfpenny. (The door leading to the hall opens, and\n",
      "HOVSTAD and ASLAKSEN make their appearance.) Look at those two!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (staring at them). What the devil!—have YOU actually the\n",
      "face to come into my house?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. We have something to say to you, you see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morten Kiil (in a whisper). Yes or no—before two o'clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen (glancing at HOVSTAD). Aha! (MORTEN KIIL goes out.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well, what do you want with me? Be brief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. I can quite understand that you are annoyed with us for our\n",
      "attitude at the meeting yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Attitude, do you call it? Yes, it was a charming\n",
      "attitude! I call it weak, womanish—damnably shameful!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Call it what you like, we could not do otherwise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. You DARED not do otherwise—isn't that it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Well, if you like to put it that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. But why did you not let us have word of it beforehand?—just\n",
      "a hint to Mr. Hovstad or to me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. A hint? Of what?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Of what was behind it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I don't understand you in the least—\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen (with a confidential nod). Oh yes, you do, Dr. Stockmann.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. It is no good making a mystery of it any longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (looking first at one of them and then at the other).\n",
      "What the devil do you both mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. May I ask if your father-in-law is not going round the town\n",
      "buying up all the shares in the Baths?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, he has been buying Baths shares today; but—\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. It would have been more prudent to get someone else to do\n",
      "it—someone less nearly related to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. And you should not have let your name appear in the affair.\n",
      "There was no need for anyone to know that the attack on the Baths came\n",
      "from you. You ought to have consulted me, Dr. Stockmann.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (looks in front of him; then a light seems to dawn on him\n",
      "and he says in amazement.) Are such things conceivable? Are such things\n",
      "possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen (with a smile). Evidently they are. But it is better to use a\n",
      "little finesse, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. And it is much better to have several persons in a thing of\n",
      "that sort; because the responsibility of each individual is lessened,\n",
      "when there are others with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (composedly). Come to the point, gentlemen. What do you\n",
      "want?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Perhaps Mr. Hovstad had better—\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. No, you tell him, Aslaksen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Well, the fact is that, now we know the bearings of the whole\n",
      "affair, we think we might venture to put the \"People's Messenger\" at\n",
      "your disposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Do you dare do that now? What about public opinion? Are\n",
      "you not afraid of a storm breaking upon our heads?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. We will try to weather it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. And you must be ready to go off quickly on a new tack,\n",
      "Doctor. As soon as your invective has done its work—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Do you mean, as soon as my father-in-law and I have got\n",
      "hold of the shares at a low figure?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. Your reasons for wishing to get the control of the Baths are\n",
      "mainly scientific, I take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Of course; it was for scientific reasons that I\n",
      "persuaded the old \"Badger\" to stand in with me in the matter. So we\n",
      "will tinker at the conduit-pipes a little, and dig up a little bit of\n",
      "the shore, and it shan't cost the town a sixpence. That will be all\n",
      "right—eh?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. I think so—if you have the \"People's Messenger\" behind you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. The Press is a power in a free community. Doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Quite so. And so is public opinion. And you, Mr.\n",
      "Aslaksen—I suppose you will be answerable for the Householders'\n",
      "Association?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Yes, and for the Temperance Society. You may rely on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. But, gentlemen—I really am ashamed to ask the\n",
      "question—but, what return do you—?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. We should prefer to help you without any return whatever,\n",
      "believe me. But the \"People's Messenger\" is in rather a shaky\n",
      "condition; it doesn't go really well; and I should be very unwilling to\n",
      "suspend the paper now, when there is so much work to do here in the\n",
      "political way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Quite so; that would be a great trial to such a friend\n",
      "of the people as you are. (Flares up.) But I am an enemy of the people,\n",
      "remember! (Walks about the room.) Where have I put my stick? Where the\n",
      "devil is my stick?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. What's that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Surely you never mean—\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (standing still.) And suppose I don't give you a single\n",
      "penny of all I get out of it? Money is not very easy to get out of us\n",
      "rich folk, please to remember!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. And you please to remember that this affair of the shares can\n",
      "be represented in two ways!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Yes, and you are just the man to do it. If I don't come\n",
      "to the rescue of the \"People's Messenger,\" you will certainly take an\n",
      "evil view of the affair; you will hunt me down, I can well\n",
      "imagine—pursue me—try to throttle me as a dog does a hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. It is a natural law; every animal must fight for its own\n",
      "livelihood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. And get its food where it can, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (walking about the room). Then you go and look for yours\n",
      "in the gutter; because I am going to show you which is the strongest\n",
      "animal of us three! (Finds an umbrella and brandishes it above his\n",
      "head.) Ah, now—!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. You are surely not going to use violence!\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen. Take care what you are doing with that umbrella.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Out of the window with you, Mr. Hovstad!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad (edging to the door). Are you quite mad!\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Out of the window, Mr. Aslaksen! Jump, I tell you! You\n",
      "will have to do it, sooner or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen (running round the writing-table). Moderation, Doctor—I am a\n",
      "delicate man—I can stand so little—(calls out) help, help!\n",
      "\n",
      "(MRS. STOCKMANN, PETRA and HORSTER come in from the sitting-room.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Good gracious, Thomas! What is happening?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (brandishing the umbrella). Jump out, I tell you! Out\n",
      "into the gutter!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hovstad. An assault on an unoffending man! I call you to witness,\n",
      "Captain Horster. (Hurries out through the hall.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Aslaksen (irresolutely). If only I knew the way about here—. (Steals\n",

      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann (throwing down the umbrella). Upon my soul, they have\n",
      "escaped after all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. What did they want you to do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I will tell you later on; I have something else to think\n",
      "about now. (Goes to the table and writes something on a calling-card.)\n",
      "Look there, Katherine; what is written there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Stockmann. Three big Noes; what does that mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. I will tell you that too, later on. (Holds out the card\n",
      "to PETRA.) There, Petra; tell sooty-face to run over to the \"Badger's\"\n",
      "with that, as quick as she can. Hurry up! (PETRA takes the card and\n",
      "goes out to the hall.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Stockmann. Well, I think I have had a visit from every one of the\n",
      "devil's messengers to-day! But now I am going to sharpen my pen till\n",
