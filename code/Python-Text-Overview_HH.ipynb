This is useful for understanding how a word is used throughout the text, spotting patterns, or exploring themes. Simply pass the word you’re interested in, and NLTK will display a nicely aligned snippet of each instance with a few words before and after it.Here we look up the word \"town\" in the guthenberg text:"

        "Counting words and analyzing their frequencies are fundamental steps when working with text data in NLP. These simple utilities help us understand the **size, diversity, and structure** of a text before moving on to more advanced analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Total Number of Tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "First, let's find out the total length of our text in terms of words and punctuation symbols (called **tokens**). We can use Python’s `len()` function on our `text_nltk` object:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "> **What is a token?**\n",
        "> A token is a sequence of characters that we want to treat as a single unit. It could be a word (`hairy`), a short word (`his`), or even a punctuation mark or symbol (`:)`). Counting tokens means counting **all occurrences** of these sequences.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> For instance, in the phrase *“to be or not to be”*:\n",
        ">\n",

        "> * `be` occurs 2 times\n",
        "> * `or` occurs 1 time\n",
        "> * `not` occurs 1 time\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Number of Unique Tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we might want to know how many **unique tokens** the text contains. We can use Python’s `set()` function, which removes duplicates:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "sorted(set(text_nltk))  # Shows all unique tokens in alphabetical order\n",
        "len(set(text_nltk))     # Counts the number of unique tokens\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "* `sorted(set(text_nltk))` will display the full list of unique tokens alphabetically.\n",
        "* `len(set(text_nltk))` returns a single number: the total count of **distinct tokens**.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Why only one number instead of two?**\n",
        ">\n",
        "> * `len(text_nltk)` gives the total number of tokens, counting duplicates.\n",
        "> * `len(set(text_nltk))` gives the number of **unique** tokens, ignoring duplicates.\n",
        ">\n",

        "\n",
        "Knowing the number of tokens and unique tokens helps you:\n",
