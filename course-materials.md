## Books
There is no single textbook. Here are a few reference books - my teaching material will be based on these. We will try to rely on publicly accessible resources for as much as possible.

- ["Python for Everybody" by Charles Severance](https://www.py4e.com/html3/) (For Python overview)
- [NLTK book](https://nltk.org/book) (For NLP with Python overview)
- ["Practical Natural Language Processing" by Sowmya Vajjala, Bodhisattwa Majumder, Anuj Gupta and Harshit Surana](https://www.amazon.de/Practical-Natural-Language-Processing-Pragmatic/dp/1492054054/). The book is also available for free on O'Reilly's online learning platform (if your university is subscribed).
- "Speech and Language Processing" by Jurafsky and Martin [2nd Edition](https://github.com/rain1024/slp2-pdf). [3rd Edition](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)

One book that may be useful is this 2022 book: "Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences" by Justin Grimmer, Margaret E. Roberts, Brandon M. Stewart, published by Princeton University Press. The [Google Books Preview](https://books.google.ca/books?id=dL40EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) seems interesting. 

## Papers from Economics journals - 1
The following is a list of papers at the intersection of NLP and Economics I compiled from some past readings and exploring google scholar's list of 20 most cited Economics journals. The list is neither complete nor objective and I did not read everything. A lot of these are published in NLP venues. You are free to choose any other relevant paper for the group discussions. You can find links to these by searching for titles on Google Scholar.
